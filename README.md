# EasyEat-Project

In San Diego, gas prices are high, and restaurants are spread across the entire city. 
Many people struggle to find a restaurant that fits their preferences: time, budget, and distance of the restaurant. 
The “Easy Eat” app solves this problem. As a student, sometimes you only have a short amount of time between your classes. 
So, you need to decide quickly on a place to eat that is within your time range and budget. 
To help people decide on where to eat, our phone-based application will choose the restaurant for you based on the before mentioned preferences. 
“Easy Eat” will target students or workers who have a tight schedule and a limited time to go out and eat.


“Easy Eat” will help anyone pick a restaurant during breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 
First, this phone-based application will prompt the user on the time preference. 
The user can input any travel time they want, for example 5 minutes, 15 minutes, etc. 
Then, the app will ask for the budget preference, where the user can give the level of the budget they want to spend on the restaurant. 
The user’s location is also going to be used by the app, in order to calculate the distance that the user need to travel to get to the restaurant. 
After getting all of the information, “Easy Eat” will randomly choose a restaurant based on these user inputted preferences. 
The app will then display a restaurant, along with its picture, pricing, distance, and ratings. 
Then the user can choose to either accept or reject the restaurant choice. If they choose to reject, then the app will give the user another option. 
If they choose to accept, then the application will provide the restaurant's picture, name, rating, distance, ETA, price, and address.
